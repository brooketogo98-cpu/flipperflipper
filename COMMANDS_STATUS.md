# Commands Implementation Status

## Test Results

### Phase 1: Basic Commands
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ping | ✅ Working | Verified in tests |
| sysinfo | ✅ Working | Returns system info |
| exec | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists, needs protocol fix |
| pwd | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists |
| ps | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists |
| shell | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists |
| download | ⚠️ Stub | Needs implementation |
| upload | ⚠️ Stub | Needs implementation |

### Phase 2: Injection
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| inject | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists |
| persist | ⚠️ Implemented | Handler exists |

### Phase 3: Advanced
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| install_rootkit | ⚠️ Stub | Returns simulated success |
| ghost_process | ⚠️ Stub | Returns simulated success |
| harvest_creds | ⚠️ Stub | Returns simulated success |
| setup_dns_tunnel | ⚠️ Stub | Returns simulated success |

## Known Issues

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: After 2-3 commands, socket disconnects
   - Cause: Enhanced encrypted protocol needs matching bridge implementation
   - Fix needed: Update native_protocol_bridge.py to handle new format
   
2. **File Transfer**: Upload/download are stubs
   - Need full implementation with chunking
   
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features return simulated responses
   - These are placeholders for future implementation

## Working Features

✅ Basic connectivity (ping, sysinfo)
✅ AES-256-CTR encryption
✅ Target detection
✅ Multi-target management
✅ Web dashboard integration

## Recommendation

System is operational for basic C2 functions. For production use:
1. Fix protocol bridge for multi-command sessions
2. Implement file transfer
3. Complete Phase 3 features
