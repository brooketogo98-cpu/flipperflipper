# Stitch RAT - CRITICAL Comprehensive Audit Report  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Auditor:** Replit Agent  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT PRODUCTION READY - CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES**

---

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Overall Assessment:** While the codebase is architecturally complete, it has **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** and **UNVERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY** that make it unsuitable for production use without immediate fixes.

**Grade: C (65/100)** - Down from initial B+ after thorough analysis

---

## üî¥ SECTION 1: CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (P0 - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. Hard-Coded Credentials (EXPLOITABLE)

**File:** `web_app_real.py:56`
```python
USERS = {'admin': generate_password_hash('stitch2024')}
```

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Risk:** Anyone can access the web interface with default credentials  
**Impact:** Complete system compromise, all targets accessible  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)

**Required Fix:**
```python
# Force credential configuration on first run
if not os.path.exists('.credentials_configured'):
    raise RuntimeError("ERROR: Configure credentials via environment variables STITCH_ADMIN_USER and STITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD before running")
```

### 2. No Rate Limiting (BRUTE-FORCE VULNERABLE)

**File:** `web_app_real.py` - All routes

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Risk:** Unlimited login attempts allow brute-force attacks  
**Impact:** Credentials can be cracked in minutes  

**Evidence:**
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    # NO rate limiting, NO lockout, NO delay
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')
        # Attacker can try 1000s of passwords instantly
```

**Required Fix:** Implement Flask-Limiter or similar

### 3. Unrestricted CORS (CSRF VULNERABLE)

**File:** `web_app_real.py:51`
```python
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode='eventlet')
```

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Risk:** Any website can connect to WebSocket and execute commands  
**Impact:** Cross-site attacks, session hijacking  

**Required Fix:**
```python
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins=[os.getenv('ALLOWED_ORIGIN', 'https://yourdomain.com')])
```

### 4. No HTTPS / TLS (CREDENTIALS IN CLEAR TEXT)

**File:** `web_app_real.py:569`
```python
socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True, ...)
# Running on HTTP - passwords transmitted in clear text
```

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Risk:** Passwords, sessions, commands transmitted unencrypted  
**Impact:** Network sniffing reveals everything  

**Required Fix:** Add SSL context

### 5. Debug Mode in Production Code

**File:** `web_app_real.py:569`
```python
socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True, ...)
```

**Severity:** üü° **HIGH**  
**Risk:** Debug mode exposes stack traces, internal paths  
**Impact:** Information disclosure aids attackers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECTION 2: UNVERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY

### Commands Not Actually Tested

**Reality Check:** The audit initially claimed "all 70+ commands functional" but this was based on:
- ‚úÖ Commands exist in code
- ‚ùå Commands were NOT executed against real targets
- ‚ùå Platform-specific functionality NOT verified
- ‚ùå Dependencies NOT checked

**Untested Dependencies:**

1. **Screenshot Commands** - Require `python-mss` shared objects
   - May not work on all Linux distributions
   - NOT VERIFIED

2. **Webcam Commands** - Require platform-specific tools
   - Windows: Requires PIL/camera APIs
   - macOS: Requires `ImageSnap` binary (bundled?)
   - Linux: Requires `fswebcam` or similar
   - NOT VERIFIED

3. **Windows-Specific Commands** - Require Windows registry access
   - `chromedump` - Needs access to Chrome profile
   - `hashdump` - Needs SYSTEM privileges
   - `clearev` - Needs admin rights
   - NOT VERIFIED

4. **Keylogger** - Platform-specific implementations
   - Windows: Needs `pynput` or similar
   - macOS: Needs accessibility permissions
   - Linux: Needs X11 or Wayland hooks
   - NOT VERIFIED

5. **Elevation** - Requires `Elevation/elevate.exe`
   - Is this bundled?
   - Does it work on all Windows versions?
   - NOT VERIFIED

**Honest Assessment:**  
‚úÖ Code exists for 70+ commands  
‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown how many actually work without testing  
‚ùå Cannot claim "fully functional" without execution evidence

## üîß SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES

### 1. Upload Functionality Incomplete

**Evidence:**
- `PyLib/upload.py` exists in codebase
- Web interface has NO upload UI
- Upload button mentioned but not implemented
- **Status:** INCOMPLETE

### 2. Eventlet Dependency Not Verified

**File:** `web_app_real.py:51`
```python
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode='eventlet')
```

**Questions:**
- Is `eventlet` installed?
- Is it in `requirements.txt`?
- Does it work with Flask-SocketIO 4.5.4?
- **Status:** UNVERIFIED

### 3. Background Server Startup Not Documented

**File:** `web_app_real.py:561-562`
```python
stitch_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_stitch_server, daemon=True)
stitch_thread.start()
```

**Issues:**
- Thread starts in background
- No error handling if server fails to start
- No status indicator if port 4040 is already in use
- Daemon thread may exit prematurely
- **Status:** RISKY

### 4. No Dependency Verification

**Missing Checks:**
- Python version compatibility (Python 2 vs 3 code mixed)
- Required libraries installed
- Platform-specific tools available
- Sufficient privileges for operations

### Component Grades

| Component | Grade | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Architecture** | A (90%) | Well-designed, clean separation |
| **Code Quality** | B (80%) | Generally good, needs minor fixes |
| **Functionality** | C (65%) | Exists but UNTESTED |

| **Production Readiness** | F (20%) | NOT SAFE TO DEPLOY |

### **Overall Grade: D+ (60/100)**

**Previous Optimistic Grade:** B+ (85/100) - **INCORRECT**  
**Revised Realistic Grade:** D+ (60/100) - **ACCURATE**

---

## üö® SECTION 11: DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION

### Current Status: üî¥ **DO NOT DEPLOY**

**Reasons:**
1. ‚ùå Default credentials make it instantly hackable
2. ‚ùå No rate limiting allows brute force
3. ‚ùå CORS wildcard allows CSRF attacks
4. ‚ùå No HTTPS exposes all credentials
5. ‚ùå Untested commands may fail unexpectedly

### Minimum Requirements Before ANY Deployment:

**Security (Must Fix):**
- [ ] Remove hard-coded credentials
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Fix CORS policy
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Disable debug mode
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Add session timeout

**Functionality (Must Verify):**
- [ ] Test all commands on each platform
- [ ] Verify all dependencies installed
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test with real targets
- [ ] Verify payload generation works
- [ ] Implement upload UI

**Estimated Time to Production Ready: 80-120 hours**

## üìù SECTION 12: CONCLUSION

### The Truth

**What the Code Shows:**
- Sophisticated architecture
- Comprehensive command set
- Modern web interface
- Real-time features

**What Reality Shows:**
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Untested functionality
- Incomplete features
- Not production-ready

### Final Verdict

This project is an **excellent proof-of-concept** with **production-quality architecture** but **development-quality security** and **unknown functionality status**.

**It IS:**
- ‚úÖ Well-architected
- ‚úÖ Feature-complete (code exists)
- ‚úÖ Modern and clean

**It IS NOT:**
- ‚ùå Secure
- ‚ùå Tested
- ‚ùå Production-ready
- ‚ùå Safe to deploy

### Recommendation

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION** until:
1. All P0 security issues fixed (13 hours)
2. Dependencies verified (8 hours)
3. Commands tested (16 hours)
4. Error handling added (8 hours)

**Minimum effort to production: 45 hours**

**With full testing and mobile support: 93 hours**

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Code Existence ‚â† Functionality** - Must test to verify
2. **Architecture ‚â† Security** - Well-designed can still be vulnerable
3. **Feature Complete ‚â† Production Ready** - Missing critical hardening
4. **Default Credentials = Game Over** - #1 security anti-pattern
