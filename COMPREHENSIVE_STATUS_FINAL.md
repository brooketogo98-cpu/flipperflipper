## ⚠️ NEEDS REFINEMENT

### Protocol Bridge Response Handling
**Issue:** Commands send successfully but responses not parsed correctly  
**Impact:** LOW - Commands execute, just need better response handling  
**Fix:** Update native_protocol_bridge.py to parse encrypted response format  
**Time:** 30 minutes

### File Transfer Implementation
**Issue:** Upload/download are stubs  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Core feature missing  
**Fix:** Implement chunked file transfer in commands.c  
**Time:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 3 Features
**Issue:** Advanced commands return simulated responses  
**Impact:** LOW - These are future enhancements  
**Fix:** Full rootkit/DNS tunnel/harvester implementation  
**Time:** 4-8 hours per feature
