# Dashboard Audit Report

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Missing API Routes** (Frontend calls routes that don't exist)
- `/api/files/downloads` - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- `/api/files/download/<filename>` - NOT IMPLEMENTED  
- `/api/debug-logs` - NEED TO VERIFY
- `/api/payload/generate` - WRONG PATH (backend uses `/api/generate-payload`)

### 2. **Design Issues**
- Basic Bootstrap-like design, not modern/wave-like
- No animations or smooth transitions
- Not visually impressive

### 3. **Functionality Issues**
- Files section completely non-functional (no backend)

### Priority 2: Modern Design
1. ❌ Add wave/gradient backgrounds
2. ❌ Add smooth animations
3. ❌ Modern card designs with glassmorphism
4. ❌ Better color scheme
5. ❌ Responsive improvements

### Priority 3: Missing Features
1. ❌ File upload functionality
