## ⚠️ Minor Notes (Not Issues)

### 1. Python Warnings (Cosmetic Only)
```
SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\W'
SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\ '
```
**Impact**: None - these are cosmetic warnings in string literals
**Status**: Does not affect functionality

### 2. Missing Config Files (Auto-Created)
- `st_config` and `hist_ini` files don't exist initially
- **Status**: ✅ Auto-created when needed - this is normal behavior

### 3. Platform-Specific Features
- Some commands only work on specific OS (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- **Status**: ✅ This is by design - documented in COMMANDS_INVENTORY.md
