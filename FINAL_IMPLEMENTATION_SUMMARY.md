## 💡 ARCHITECTURAL HIGHLIGHTS

### Dual Protocol Support:
```python
if is_native_payload:
    # Use native C protocol bridge
    native_bridge.send_native_command(sock, command)
else:
    # Use Python Stitch library
    execute_on_target(sock, command, aes_key)
```

### Automatic Detection:
```python
# Detects payload type from handshake
payload_type = native_bridge.detect_payload_type(sock)
# Returns: 'native' or 'python'
```

### Enhanced Metadata:
```python
target_info = {
    'encryption': 'AES-256-CTR',
    'uptime': 3600,
    'commands_executed': 42,
    'last_command': 'sysinfo',
    'status': 'online'
}
```
