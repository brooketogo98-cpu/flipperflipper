## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES (Quick Fixes)

### 1. Web Server Port Binding (~30 mins)
```python
Issue: Port 19876 sometimes busy
Fix: Add port availability check and fallback
Impact: Minor - just configuration
```

### 2. Integration Test Edge Cases (~1 hour)
```python
Issue: Some API endpoints need CSRF token handling
Fix: Update test suite to handle tokens properly
Impact: Testing only - functionality works
```

---

## üöÄ HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM

### 1. Start the Web Interface:
```bash
cd /workspace
export STITCH_DEBUG=true  # For development
python3 web_app_real.py

# Or for production:
export STITCH_ADMIN_USER="your_username"
export STITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
python3 web_app_real.py
```

### 2. Access Dashboard:
```
http://localhost:19876
Login: admin / SecureTestPassword123! (in debug mode)
```

### 3. Generate Payload:
- Navigate to "Native Payload" section
- Configure target (OS, C2 server)
- Click "Generate Payload"
- Download compiled binary

### 4. Deploy & Control:
- Execute payload on target
- Monitor connections in dashboard
- Use command interface for control
- Access Phase 3 advanced features
