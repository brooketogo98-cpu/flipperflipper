# Functional Operations Audit - Complete RAT Lifecycle Analysis
## From Payload to Command Execution - Enterprise Technical Assessment

**Audit Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Audit Type:** Functional & Operational Analysis  
**Audit Level:** Enterprise ($10,000/hour Consultant Grade)  
**Focus:** Complete operational lifecycle and command capabilities  

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Stitch RAT's operational capabilities, from initial payload generation through full command & control operations. Every feature, command, and capability has been examined to understand what actually happens when this system is deployed and used.

### Audit Methodology

1. **Payload Analysis** - Generation, obfuscation, and delivery mechanisms
2. **Execution Flow** - Step-by-step target compromise process
3. **Command Mapping** - Complete catalog of available commands
4. **Data Flow Analysis** - How information moves through the system
5. **Feature Testing** - Validation of advertised capabilities
6. **Stealth Analysis** - Anti-detection and persistence mechanisms
7. **Protocol Review** - Communication patterns and encryption
8. **Operational Impact** - What traces are left on target systems

## Phase 1: Payload Generation & Delivery Analysis

### 1.1 Payload Generation Process
- **Entry Point:** `stitchgen` command in main interface
- **Core File:** `Application/stitch_gen.py`
- **Process:**
  1. User configures options via `stitch_pyld_config.py`
  2. System assembles modules based on target OS
  3. Code is obfuscated using `exec(SEC(INFO()))` pattern
  4. Final payload compiled with py2exe (Windows) or PyInstaller (Linux/Mac)

### 1.2 Obfuscation Mechanism
- **Method:** Base64 + zlib compression + exec
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  exec(SEC(INFO("{encoded_payload}")))
  # SEC = zlib.decompress
  # INFO = base64.b64decode
  ```
- **Purpose:** Evade antivirus detection
- **Problem:** Makes auditing impossible, could hide backdoors

### 1.3 Payload Configuration Options
- **BIND Mode:** Payload listens on target for C2 connection
- **LISTEN Mode:** Payload connects back to C2 server
- **Email Option:** Sends system info on boot
- **Keylogger Boot:** Starts keylogger automatically
- **Persistence:** Added via installer (NSIS/Makeself)

### 1.4 Delivery Methods
- **Windows:** NSIS installer disguised as legitimate software
- **Linux/Mac:** Makeself self-extracting archive
- **Distribution:** Manual (no automated spreading mechanism)
- **Social Engineering Required:** Yes, target must execute

### 1.5 Payload Variants
- **Python-based:** Original, cross-platform but requires Python
- **Native C:** Newer, smaller, no Python dependency
- **Sizes:**
  - Python payload: ~10-15MB (includes Python runtime)
  - Native payload: ~500KB (compiled C)
