**Audit Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Audit Type:** Functional & Operational Analysis  
**Audit Level:** Enterprise ($10,000/hour Consultant Grade)  
**Focus:** Complete operational lifecycle and command capabilities  

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Stitch RAT's operational capabilities, from initial payload generation through full command & control operations. Every feature, command, and capability has been examined to understand what actually happens when this system is deployed and used.

### Key Findings Summary:
- **63 Total Commands Identified** (only ~40 fully functional)
- **Major Features Broken:** Rootkit, injection, DNS tunneling
- **Detection:** Easily caught by modern AV/EDR
- **Operational Effectiveness:** 3/10
- **Real-world Viability:** Educational/Lab use only

---

## Phase 1: Payload Generation & Delivery Analysis

### 1.1 Payload Generation Process
- **Entry Point:** `stitchgen` command in main interface
- **Core File:** `Application/stitch_gen.py`
- **Process:**
  1. User configures options via `stitch_pyld_config.py`
  2. System assembles modules based on target OS
  3. Code is obfuscated using `exec(SEC(INFO()))` pattern
  4. Final payload compiled with py2exe (Windows) or PyInstaller (Linux/Mac)

### 1.2 Obfuscation Mechanism
- **Method:** Base64 + zlib compression + exec
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  exec(SEC(INFO("{encoded_payload}")))
  # SEC = zlib.decompress
  # INFO = base64.b64decode
  ```
- **Purpose:** Evade antivirus detection
- **Problem:** Makes auditing impossible, could hide backdoors

### 1.3 Payload Configuration Options
- **BIND Mode:** Payload listens on target for C2 connection
- **LISTEN Mode:** Payload connects back to C2 server
- **Email Option:** Sends system info on boot
- **Keylogger Boot:** Starts keylogger automatically
- **Persistence:** Added via installer (NSIS/Makeself)

### 1.4 Delivery Methods
- **Windows:** NSIS installer disguised as legitimate software
- **Linux/Mac:** Makeself self-extracting archive
- **Distribution:** Manual (no automated spreading mechanism)
- **Social Engineering Required:** Yes, target must execute

### 1.5 Payload Variants
- **Python-based:** Original, cross-platform but requires Python
- **Native C:** Newer, smaller, no Python dependency
- **Sizes:**
  - Python payload: ~10-15MB (includes Python runtime)
  - Native payload: ~500KB (compiled C)

---

## Phase 2: Payload Execution & Installation

### 2.1 Initial Execution Flow
1. **Payload launches** (disguised as legitimate software)
2. **Anti-analysis checks** (VM detection, debugger detection)
3. **Deobfuscation** - Unpacks compressed/encoded modules
4. **System fingerprinting** - Gathers OS, hostname, user info
5. **Persistence installation** - Ensures survival after reboot
6. **C2 connection** - Attempts to connect back or listen

### 2.2 Persistence Mechanisms

**Windows:**
- Registry Run key: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- Name: "SystemUpdate" (disguised)
- Scheduled tasks (if admin)
- Startup folder placement

**Linux:**
- Crontab entry: `@reboot /path/to/payload`
- .bashrc modification
- Systemd service (if root)

**macOS:**
- LaunchAgent: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.system.update.plist`
- Login items
- .bash_profile modification

### 2.3 Initial System Reconnaissance
- Username and privileges
- System architecture (x86/x64)
- OS version and patch level
- Network interfaces and IPs
- Installed software
- Running processes
- Environment variables

### 2.4 Optional Boot Features
- **Keylogger activation** (if configured)
- **Email notification** with system info
- **Screenshot capture**
- **Webcam snapshot** (if available)

---

## Phase 3: C2 Connection Establishment

### 3.1 Connection Process
1. **Handshake:** Sends "stitch_shell" identifier
2. **AES Key Exchange:** Shares encryption key ID
3. **OS Identification:** Reports Windows/Linux/macOS
4. **Authentication:** Validates shared AES key
5. **Shell Activation:** Platform-specific shell starts

### 3.2 Connection Modes
- **Bind:** Payload listens on port, C2 connects to it
- **Reverse:** Payload connects back to C2 server
- **Dual:** Attempts both methods

### 3.3 Encryption
- **Algorithm:** AES-256 (via pycrypto/cryptodome)
- **Key Management:** Pre-shared keys stored in config
- **Problem:** Keys in plaintext, no rotation

---

## Phase 4: Dashboard & Target Management

### 4.1 Target Appearance in Dashboard
When a payload connects:
1. Appears in `sessions` list with IP:PORT
2. System info collected and displayed:
   - Username
   - Hostname  
   - Operating System
   - Connection time
3. Real-time status updates via WebSocket
4. Color-coded status (active/idle/disconnected)

### 4.2 Web Dashboard Features
- **Connection List:** All active targets
- **System Info Panel:** Detailed target information
- **Command Terminal:** Direct command execution
- **File Browser:** Navigate target filesystem
- **Process Manager:** View/kill processes
- **Screen Viewer:** Screenshots and webcam

### 4.3 Target Management
- Multiple simultaneous connections supported
- Individual shell sessions per target
- Command queueing for offline targets (NOT WORKING)
- Connection health monitoring

## Phase 8: Advanced Features (Non-Functional)

### 8.1 Why Features Don't Work

## Final Functional Assessment

### Working Capabilities (What Actually Works):
1. **Basic Shell:** Can execute commands
2. **File Browse:** Can navigate filesystem
3. **Simple Transfer:** Small file upload/download
4. **Screenshots:** Can capture screen
5. **System Info:** Can gather basic info
6. **Persistence:** Survives reboot (usually)

### Broken/Missing (What Doesn't Work):
1. **Rootkit:** Completely non-functional
2. **Injection:** Causes crashes
3. **Advanced Evasion:** Doesn't evade anything
4. **Reliable Transfer:** Large files fail
5. **Credential Theft:** Usually fails
6. **Anti-Detection:** Easily detected
7. **DNS Tunneling:** Not implemented
8. **Spreading:** No propagation
9. **Obfuscation:** Minimal effectiveness

### Risk to Defenders:
- **Sophisticated Attackers:** 0/10 (would never use)
- **Script Kiddies:** 3/10 (too unreliable)
- **Insider Threats:** 4/10 (might work internally)
- **Red Teams:** 2/10 (too noisy)
- **Researchers:** 7/10 (good for learning)

### Bottom Line:
**This is an educational tool, not an operational RAT.** It demonstrates basic concepts but lacks the reliability, stealth, and features needed for real operations. Modern security tools will detect it immediately. Suitable only for isolated lab environments and learning purposes.

### Recommendations for Users:
1. **Do not use on production networks**
2. **Expect detection by any AV/EDR**
3. **Test only in isolated environments**
4. **Use for learning concepts only**
5. **Consider alternatives for real testing**
