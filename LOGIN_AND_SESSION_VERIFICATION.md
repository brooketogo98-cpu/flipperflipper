## ✅ Authentication Flow - VERIFIED

### 1. **Login Process** (`/login` route)
```
User enters credentials → Form submits to /login
                       ↓
Server validates credentials against USERS dictionary
                       ↓
                 Valid? ─┬─ YES → Create session
                         │        - session['logged_in'] = True
                         │        - session['username'] = username
                         │        - session['login_time'] = timestamp
                         │        → Redirect to dashboard (/)
                         │
                         └─ NO  → Record failed attempt
                                 → Show error message
                                 → Lock after 5 attempts
```

### 2. **Session Management**
Each logged-in user gets a **unique, isolated session** with:

| Session Variable | Purpose | Example |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `session['logged_in']` | Authentication flag | `True` |
| `session['username']` | User identifier | `"admin"` |
| `session['login_time']` | Login timestamp | `"2024-10-17T13:16:35"` |
| `session.permanent` | Persistent session | `True` |

### 3. **Session Isolation & Tracking**
Every action tracks which user performed it:
- **Debug logs**: `session.get('username', 'system')` (line 229)
- **Command history**: `session.get('username')` (line 573)
- **Logout tracking**: `session.get('username', 'unknown')` (line 423)

This ensures:
- Each user's actions are logged separately
- Multiple users can be logged in simultaneously (different browser sessions)
- No cross-contamination between user sessions

## ✅ Dashboard Access Control - VERIFIED

### Protection Mechanism
The `@login_required` decorator (lines 306-312) protects all routes:

```python
def login_required(f):
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if 'logged_in' not in session:
            return redirect(url_for('login'))  # Redirect to login
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

**Protected routes:**
- `/` (Dashboard) - requires login
- `/api/connections` - requires login
- `/api/execute` - requires login
- `/api/upload` - requires login
- All other API endpoints - require login

### Logout Process
`/logout` route:
1. Retrieves username from session
2. Logs the logout action
3. Clears entire session: `session.clear()`
4. Redirects to login page

---

## ✅ Per-User Connection Management - VERIFIED

### How It Works for Each User
When a user logs in and accesses the dashboard:

1. **Real-time connection display** - Same connections visible to all admins
2. **Per-user command history** - Each user's commands tracked separately
3. **Per-user session tracking** - Username logged with every action
4. **Per-user rate limiting** - Rate limits tracked per session

### Connection Selection & Commands
- User selects a connection → `selectedConnection` variable set in JavaScript
- User executes command → Server checks:
  - ✅ Is user logged in? (`@login_required`)
  - ✅ Is connection online? (check `server.inf_sock`)
  - ✅ Is rate limit OK? (`@limiter.limit`)
  - ✅ Is input valid? (validation checks)
- Command executed → Response returned to **that specific user's browser**
- Action logged with **that user's username** in command history

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication Security
1. **Password hashing** - Passwords stored with `check_password_hash()`
2. **CSRF protection** - Token required on all forms
3. **Rate limiting** - 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
4. **Failed attempt tracking** - Per-IP address lockout
5. **Session timeout** - Configurable session duration
6. **Secure session cookies** - Flask session management

### Session Security
1. **Server-side sessions** - Session data stored on server
2. **Session isolation** - Each user gets unique session ID
3. **Logout clears session** - Complete session cleanup
4. **No session fixation** - New session on each login

## 🎯 Default Credentials

**Username:** `admin`  
**Password:** `stitch2024`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change these credentials in production!

Set via environment variables:
- `STITCH_ADMIN_USER` - Username (12+ characters required)
- `STITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password (12+ characters required)

## 🚀 How Users Experience the System

### First-Time User
1. Navigate to application URL → Redirected to login page
2. See beautiful login form with default credentials
3. Enter: username `admin`, password `stitch2024`
4. Click "LOGIN" button
5. Session created, redirected to dashboard
6. See all active connections, can execute commands

### Returning User (Session Active)
1. Navigate to application URL
2. Session valid → Direct access to dashboard
3. Continue working with connections

### Logout
1. Click "Logout" button in dashboard
2. Session cleared
3. Redirected to login page
4. Must login again to access dashboard

### Multiple Users Simultaneously
- **User A** logs in from Browser 1 → Gets Session A
- **User B** logs in from Browser 2 → Gets Session B
- Both see the same connections (shared Stitch server)
- Each user's commands logged separately
- Session A and Session B are completely isolated
- No interference between users
