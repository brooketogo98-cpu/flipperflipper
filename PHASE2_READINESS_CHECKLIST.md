# Phase 2 Readiness Checklist

## Phase 1 Foundation Status ✅

### Core Components Ready:
- ✅ Native C/C++ payload framework (39KB binary)
- ✅ Modular architecture (core, crypto, network, platform)
- ✅ Command execution framework (10 commands)
- ✅ Anti-analysis base (debugger, VM, sandbox detection)
- ✅ Web integration (API endpoints, UI)
- ✅ Python builder with compilation pipeline

### What Phase 2 Will Build On:
1. **commands.c** - Ready to add injection commands
2. **winapi.c** - Has inject_process_windows() stub
3. **linux_impl.c** - Ready for Linux injection methods
4. **utils.c** - Memory management functions ready
5. **Web UI** - Can add injection options to payload generator

## Phase 2 Objectives (Process Injection & Hollowing)

### Windows Techniques to Implement:
- [ ] Classic DLL Injection (SetWindowsHookEx, CreateRemoteThread)
- [ ] Process Hollowing (NtUnmapViewOfSection)
- [ ] APC Queue Injection (QueueUserAPC)
- [ ] SetThreadContext Injection
- [ ] PE Manual Mapping
- [ ] Reflective DLL Injection

### Linux Techniques to Implement:
- [ ] ptrace() injection
- [ ] LD_PRELOAD hijacking
- [ ] /proc/[pid]/mem injection
- [ ] VDSO hijacking
- [ ] .so injection via dlopen()

### Evasion Enhancements:
- [ ] Direct syscalls (bypass API hooks)
- [ ] NTDLL unhooking (already started)
- [ ] ETW bypass
- [ ] AMSI bypass
- [ ] Delayed/triggered execution

### Web Integration:
- [ ] Add injection target selector to UI
- [ ] Process enumeration endpoint
- [ ] Injection method dropdown
- [ ] Success/failure reporting

## Prerequisites Check:

### Required for Phase 2:
- ✅ Stable payload framework (Phase 1)
- ✅ Command infrastructure
- ✅ Memory management utilities
- ✅ Platform-specific code structure
- ⚠️ Windows dev environment (for testing)
- ⚠️ More sophisticated process enumeration

### Nice to Have:
- ⚠️ Kernel driver (for rootkit features)
- ⚠️ Hypervisor detection
- ⚠️ Code signing certificate

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Start with Windows** - More injection techniques available
2. **Implement simplest first** - CreateRemoteThread injection
3. **Test detection** - Use Windows Defender, common AVs
4. **Add Linux methods** - ptrace() based injection
5. **Enhance UI** - Add process selection interface

## Risk Considerations:

⚠️ **Phase 2 is significantly more detectable than Phase 1**
- Process injection triggers many security products
- Requires careful implementation to avoid crashes
- Some techniques require elevated privileges
- Testing should be done in isolated VMs

## Ready for Phase 2? ✅

**YES** - All Phase 1 foundations are solid:
- Payload framework complete
- Command system extensible
- Web integration working
- Anti-analysis base implemented

The codebase is well-structured to add injection capabilities.
