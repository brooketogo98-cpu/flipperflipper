# ProxyAssessmentTool - Implementation Summary

## Executive Overview

The ProxyAssessmentTool is a Windows desktop application designed for autonomous discovery and assessment of potentially misconfigured proxy services within owned or explicitly authorized assets. The tool enforces strict eligibility criteria and provides comprehensive remediation guidance while maintaining a strong focus on safety, consent, and privacy.

## Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. Safety-First Architecture

**Consent-Based Operations**
- Every network operation requires valid consent ID
- Scope strictly limited to authorized networks
- Do-not-scan lists enforced at multiple levels
- Emergency stop available at all times

**No External Relay Testing**
- Validation only against owner-controlled canary endpoints
- No traffic routing through discovered proxies
- No connections to third-party services without explicit configuration

### 2. Strict Eligibility Gates

The tool implements a zero-compromise eligibility system:

```csharp
public bool IsEligible(Finding finding)
{
    return finding.Protocol == ProxyProtocol.Socks5 &&
           finding.SelectedAuthMethod == AuthMethod.NoAuth &&
           finding.FraudScore == 0 &&
           finding.CountryCode == "US" &&
           finding.IsMobile == true;
}
```

**Gate Enforcement Points:**
1. Protocol Detection: Only SOCKS5 considered
2. Authentication: Must support no-auth (0x00)
3. Reputation: Fraud score must be exactly 0/10
4. Geography: United States only with state/city
5. Network Type: Mobile carrier networks only

### 3. Comprehensive Discovery Strategy

**Passive-First Approach**
- Analyze existing proxy logs
- Process NetFlow/VPC Flow Logs
- Mine cloud configurations
- Query service meshes

**Conservative Active Scanning**
- Rate-limited port scanning
- Common proxy ports only
- Respect scan windows
- Progressive rollout

### 4. Multi-Layer Enrichment

Each discovered proxy undergoes comprehensive analysis:

1. **Protocol Fingerprinting**: RFC-compliant SOCKS5 detection
2. **Usage Classification**: Owner telemetry analysis
3. **Reputation Scoring**: Offline model with optional vendor integration
4. **Geo/ASN Enrichment**: MaxMind GeoIP2 with mobile detection
5. **Social Compatibility**: Synthetic tests by default
6. **Leakage Detection**: DNS and WebRTC leak checks
7. **Uptime Monitoring**: SLO-based health tracking
8. **Risk Assessment**: Weighted severity scoring

### 5. Enterprise-Ready Features

**Security & Compliance**
- RBAC with optional SSO (OIDC)
- Complete audit trail
- Evidence chain integrity
- Air-gapped operation mode

**Integration Capabilities**
- SIEM export (CEF/LEEF/JSON)
- Ticketing system integration
- Webhook notifications
- Read-only localhost API

**Operational Excellence**
- Self-contained .exe deployment
- Automatic updates with signing
- Windows Event Log integration
- Performance monitoring

### 6. User Experience

**Modern Windows UI**

- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility
- Touch-friendly interface

**Key Views**
- Dashboard: Metrics and risk overview

- Append-only audit log
- 90-day retention policy

**Configuration Management**
- YAML-based configuration
- Hierarchical settings
- Runtime validation
- Secure secrets (DPAPI)

By enforcing strict eligibility criteria, maintaining consent-based operations, and providing enterprise-ready features, the tool enables organizations to identify and remediate proxy misconfigurations while maintaining security and compliance standards.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY REMINDER**: This guidance is solely for consent-based assessment of your own or explicitly authorized assets. Do not use it to discover or assess third-party systems without written permission. Do not generate or run code that relays traffic through discovered proxies to external destinations.
