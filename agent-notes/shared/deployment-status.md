# VPS Deployment Status Update

## Current Issue:
The deployment script keeps failing at SSL certificate generation step, even after fixes were pushed to GitHub.

## Root Cause:
The VPS has cached/old versions of the deployment script. The fixes aren't being applied because:
1. The script downloads once and reuses the old version
2. The OpenSSL command is still failing with the old syntax

## Immediate Solution:
Skip SSL setup and start the application manually - everything else is already installed.

## Status:
- ✅ System updated
- ✅ Dependencies installed  
- ✅ Application files copied
- ✅ Python environment ready
- ✅ Configuration created
- ❌ SSL certificate generation (blocking deployment)

## Next Action:
Manual start of the application bypassing SSL issues.
