# VPS Access and Troubleshooting Plan

## Issue: Web interface not loading at http://50.21.187.77:5000

## Current Status:
- Application appeared to start successfully
- No error messages shown
- But web interface not accessible externally

## Possible Causes:
1. Application crashed after starting
2. Firewall blocking external access
3. Application binding to localhost only
4. Port forwarding issues
5. Ionos firewall blocking traffic

## Remote Access Solutions:
1. **SSH tunneling** - Forward VPS ports to local machine
2. **ngrok** - Create secure tunnel to VPS
3. **tmux/screen** - Persistent terminal sessions
4. **Web-based terminal** - Browser-based SSH access
5. **Remote desktop** - Full GUI access

## Next Steps:
1. Check if application is actually running
2. Test local connectivity on VPS
3. Check firewall rules
4. Set up remote access tool
5. Debug step by step
