### 🎨 Customization Phase (20 minutes)

#### 1. Update Template Config

**File:** `tools/brand_templates/cupidbot_ofm/config.json`

**Update with your research:**

```json
{
  "branding": {
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#FF1744",      ← Your actual color
      "secondary": "#536DFE",    ← Your actual color
      "accent": "#00BFA5"        ← Your actual color
    },
    "fonts": {
      "primary": "Inter"         ← Their actual font
    }
  },
  "product": {
    "version": "2.1.5"           ← Current version you found
  }
}
```

#### 2. Customize Landing Page

**File:** `tools/brand_templates/cupidbot_ofm/landing_page.html`

**Update CSS variables:**

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #FF1744;    /* Replace with actual */
    --secondary-color: #536DFE;  /* Replace with actual */
    --accent-color: #00BFA5;     /* Replace with actual */
}

body {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;  /* Their actual font */
}
```

**Add logo:**

```html
<div class="header">
    <!-- Update logo path -->
    <img src="logos/logo.png" alt="Cupidbot" class="logo">
</div>
```

**Match their style:**
```html
<!-- Copy sections from their actual website -->
<!-- Match: Button styles, spacing, shadows, etc. -->
```

#### 3. Write Authentic Copy

**Research their language:**
```
Visit cupidbot.ai and note:
  • How do they describe OFM?
  • What words do they use?
  • What's their tone? (formal? casual? tech-y?)
  • What do they promise users?
```

**Update your templates to match:**

```
❌ Generic: "Download this software update"
✅ Authentic: "Unlock next-level AI automation for your OF"

❌ Generic: "Bug fixes and improvements"
✅ Authentic: "10x smarter AI content generation"
```
