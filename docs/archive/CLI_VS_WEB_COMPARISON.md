1. **Visual Dashboard** - Graphical overview of all connections
2. **Search & Filter** - Find connections and files quickly
3. **Pagination** - Handle large datasets efficiently
4. **Export Data** - Download logs and history
5. **Drag & Drop Upload** - Intuitive file transfers
6. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time upload progress
7. **Confirmation Dialogs** - Safety for dangerous operations
8. **Heartbeat Monitoring** - Connection health metrics
9. **Session Management** - Multi-user support ready
10. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse
11. **CSRF Protection** - Secure against attacks

## CLI Advantages

Areas where CLI might still be preferred:

1. **Scripting** - Can be automated via scripts
2. **Lightweight** - No browser required
3. **Speed** - Direct command execution
4. **Power Users** - Some prefer terminal interface

---

## Feature Parity Conclusion

### ‚úÖ Achieved
- All 75+ commands accessible
- Full command execution capability
- Connection management
- File upload/download
- Real-time monitoring
- Command history

### üèÜ Enhanced
- Security (HTTPS, CSRF, auth, rate limiting)
- User experience (visual, responsive, organized)
- Monitoring (logs, exports, metrics)
- Safety (confirmations, validation)
- Usability (search, filter, pagination)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
- Web requires browser (not available in pure CLI env)
- Slightly more overhead than raw CLI
- Requires running Flask server (solved: runs alongside CLI)

---

## Recommendation

**Use Web Interface for:**
- Production deployments
- Team collaboration
- GUI-friendly operations
- Security-conscious environments
- Monitoring and audit requirements
- Non-technical users

**Use CLI for:**
- Automation and scripting
- Minimal resource environments
- Terminal-only access
- Quick one-off commands

**Best Approach:**
Run both simultaneously! The web server includes the CLI functionality and can handle both interfaces at once.

---

## Architecture Note

The web interface doesn't replace the CLI - it **wraps** it:
- Same `stitch_server` instance
- Same command execution logic
- Same AES encryption
- Same port 4040 for targets
- CLI commands work in web's custom input

This means **100% feature parity** is guaranteed because they share the same underlying code.
