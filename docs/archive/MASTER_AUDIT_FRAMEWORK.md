# üîç MASTER AUDIT FRAMEWORK FOR ADVANCED RAT
## What I'd Demand as Project Owner

---

## üéØ PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH

Before touching any code, understand this:
1. **Assume everything is broken** until proven otherwise
2. **Trust nothing** - not even your own code from yesterday
3. **Think like three people:**
   - A paranoid security researcher trying to detect you
   - A forensics expert trying to trace you
   - A victim trying to remove you

---

## üìä SECTION 1: OPERATIONAL SECURITY AUDIT

### 1.1 Trace Evidence Analysis
**Question: "If this RAT was discovered, what would lead back to us?"**

```bash
# Check for identifying information
grep -r "stitch\|STITCH" /workspace --include="*.c" --include="*.py"
grep -r "@.*\.com\|github\|gitlab" /workspace
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|HACK" /workspace

# Check for development artifacts
find /workspace -name "*.log" -o -name "*.bak" -o -name "*~" -o -name "*.swp"
find /workspace -name "test*" -o -name "debug*" -o -name "temp*"

# Check for hardcoded IPs/domains
grep -rE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" /workspace
grep -rE "https?://|ftp://|ssh://" /workspace
```

**What to look for:**
- Developer comments with real names/emails
- Hardcoded C2 servers that could be traced
- Debug strings that reveal development environment
- Timestamps that reveal timezone
- Unique coding patterns that fingerprint the developer

### 1.2 Cryptographic Implementation Audit
**"Is our encryption actually protecting us?"**

```python
# Test encryption implementation
def audit_encryption():
    # 1. Check for proper random initialization
    # BAD: srand(time(NULL))
    # GOOD: /dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom
    
    # 2. Verify no ECB mode (patterns visible)
    # 3. Ensure IVs are never reused
    # 4. Check key derivation (not just MD5)
    # 5. Verify secure key storage in memory
    # 6. Test for timing attacks in crypto operations
    
    # Real test:
    plaintext = b"AAAAAAAA" * 100
    ciphertext1 = encrypt(plaintext)
    ciphertext2 = encrypt(plaintext)
    
    assert ciphertext1 != ciphertext2, "IV reuse detected!"
    assert len(set(ciphertext1[i:i+16] for i in range(0, len(ciphertext1), 16))) > 10, "ECB mode detected!"
```

### 1.3 Anti-Forensics Validation
**"Can our artifacts be recovered?"**

Test scenarios:
1. **Memory forensics:** Run RAT, dump memory, search for:
   - Unencrypted strings
   - C2 addresses in plaintext
   - Credential material
   - Decryption keys

2. **Disk forensics:** After RAT runs and "cleans up":
   - Can deleted files be recovered?
   - Are logs truly wiped?
   - Check swap/pagefile for artifacts
   - Look for registry remnants (Windows)

3. **Network forensics:** Capture traffic and verify:
   - No plaintext protocols
   - No obvious patterns (beaconing intervals)
   - Traffic looks legitimate (mimics real services)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECTION 2: EVASION CAPABILITY AUDIT

### 2.1 Detection Surface Analysis
**"What would trigger detection?"**

```python
# Build detection matrix
detection_vectors = {
    "Static Analysis": [
        "Known bad strings (cmd.exe, /etc/passwd, etc)",
        "Suspicious imports (ptrace, VirtualAlloc, etc)",
        "Entropy analysis (packed/encrypted sections)",
        "Certificate verification",
        "YARA rule matching"
    ],
    "Dynamic Analysis": [
        "Process injection behavior",
        "Network connections to uncommon ports",
        "Registry/file system modifications",
        "API call sequences",
        "Memory allocation patterns"
    ],
    "Behavioral Analysis": [
        "Persistence mechanism installation",
        "Lateral movement patterns",
        "Data staging behavior",
        "C2 communication patterns",
        "Credential access attempts"
    ]
}

for category, checks in detection_vectors.items():
    print(f"\n{category}:")
    for check in checks:
        # Actually test each vector
        result = test_detection_vector(check)
        print(f"  [{result}] {check}")
```

### 2.2 EDR Bypass Testing
**"Test against real security products"**

Required test environments:
1. **Windows Defender + AMSI**
   - Does AMSI catch our PowerShell?
   - Does Defender flag our binary?
   - Are our process injections detected?

2. **Commercial EDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)**
   - Do they detect our syscalls?
   - Is our process ghosting caught?
   - Can they trace our network connections?

3. **Linux Security Modules**
   - SELinux/AppArmor detection
   - auditd logging our activities
   - osquery detecting anomalies

### 2.3 Sandbox Evasion Verification
**"Do we actually evade sandboxes?"**

```c
// Test each evasion technique actually works
void audit_sandbox_evasion() {
    // 1. Timing checks
    time_t start = time(NULL);
    sleep(10);
    assert(time(NULL) - start >= 10, "Sandbox fast-forwarded time!");
    
    // 2. Resource checks
    assert(get_cpu_count() > 1, "Single CPU detected");
    assert(get_total_ram() > 2GB, "Low memory detected");
    assert(get_disk_size() > 20GB, "Small disk detected");
    
    // 3. Human interaction checks
    assert(get_mouse_movement_count() > 0, "No mouse movement");
    assert(get_recent_documents() > 5, "No user documents");
    
    // 4. Known sandbox artifacts
    assert(!file_exists("C:\\sample.exe"), "Sandbox artifact found");
    assert(!process_exists("vboxservice.exe"), "VirtualBox detected");
}
```

```python
test_scenarios = {
    "privileges": ["admin", "user", "service", "system"],
    "architectures": ["x86", "x64", "arm64"],
    "platforms": ["Win7", "Win10", "Win11", "Ubuntu20", "Ubuntu22", "RHEL8"],
    "security": ["defender_on", "edr_present", "firewall_strict"],
    "network": ["direct", "proxy", "tor", "captive_portal"],
    "resources": ["low_memory", "low_disk", "high_cpu", "normal"]
}

for command in ALL_COMMANDS:
    for scenario in generate_combinations(test_scenarios):
        result = test_command(command, scenario)
        log_result(command, scenario, result)
```

### 3.2 Persistence Mechanism Validation
**"Will we survive what users throw at us?"**

Survival tests:
1. **System updates** - Windows Update, apt upgrade
2. **AV scans** - Full system scan with updated definitions
3. **Reboots** - Normal, safe mode, recovery mode
4. **User actions** - Clear temp, disk cleanup, ccleaner
5. **Time** - Leave running for 30+ days
6. **Restoration** - System restore, backup restoration

### 3.3 Data Exfiltration Integrity
**"Does data arrive intact and undetected?"**

```python
def audit_exfiltration():
    test_files = [
        ("small.txt", 1024),          # 1KB
        ("medium.doc", 1024*1024),    # 1MB
        ("large.zip", 100*1024*1024), # 100MB
        ("huge.iso", 1024*1024*1024)  # 1GB
    ]
    
    for filename, size in test_files:
        # Generate test file with known hash
        original_hash = generate_test_file(filename, size)
        
        # Exfiltrate via each method
        for method in ["direct", "dns", "http", "icmp"]:
            received_hash = exfiltrate_and_verify(filename, method)
            
            assert original_hash == received_hash, f"Corruption via {method}"
            assert not detected_by_dlp(), f"DLP caught {method}"
            assert bandwidth_reasonable(), f"Suspicious bandwidth via {method}"
```

# AddressSanitizer for overflows
gcc -fsanitize=address -g payload.c -o payload_asan
./payload_asan

# Static analysis
cppcheck --enable=all /workspace/native_payloads/
scan-build make

# Fuzzing
AFL++ or libFuzzer on all input handlers
```

### 4.2 Error Handling Audit

        "Network disconnected mid-operation",
        "Disk full during file write",
        "Memory allocation failure",
        "Permission denied on critical operation",
        "Target process dies during injection",
        "Corrupted command from C2",
        "Partial data transmission",
        "Clock skew between client/server",
        "Race conditions in threading"
    ]
    
    for scenario in error_scenarios:
        trigger_error(scenario)
        assert rat_still_running(), f"RAT crashed on {scenario}"
        assert no_traces_left(), f"Error traces left from {scenario}"
        assert can_recover(), f"Cannot recover from {scenario}"
```

### 4.3 Concurrency & Race Conditions
**"What breaks under load?"**

```python
def audit_concurrency():
    # Spawn multiple command handlers
    threads = []
    for i in range(100):
        threads.append(spawn_command(random_command()))
    
    # Ensure no deadlocks
    assert all_threads_complete(threads, timeout=60)
    
    # Ensure no data corruption
    assert data_integrity_maintained()
    
    # Ensure no resource leaks
    assert memory_usage_stable()
```

## üé≠ SECTION 5: BEHAVIORAL AUDIT

### 5.1 Pattern Analysis
**"Do we look suspicious?"**

Network behavior checks:
```python
def audit_network_patterns():
    # Capture 24 hours of traffic
    traffic = capture_traffic(hours=24)
    
    # Check for patterns
    beacon_intervals = analyze_beacon_timing(traffic)
    assert has_jitter(beacon_intervals), "Too regular - looks like malware"
    
    packet_sizes = analyze_packet_sizes(traffic)
    assert looks_natural(packet_sizes), "Packet sizes too uniform"
    
    dns_queries = extract_dns_queries(traffic)
    assert not suspicious_dns_pattern(dns_queries), "DNS pattern detectable"
    
    # Compare to legitimate traffic
    similarity = compare_to_legitimate_service(traffic)
    assert similarity > 0.8, "Doesn't look like legitimate traffic"
```

### 5.2 Operational Timeline Analysis
**"How do we look over time?"**

```python
def audit_timeline():
    # Run for extended period
    start_monitoring()
    run_rat_for_days(7)
    timeline = stop_monitoring()
    
    # Analyze patterns
    check_no_suspicious_bursts(timeline)
    check_no_regular_patterns(timeline)

## üîê SECTION 6: SECURITY POSTURE AUDIT

### 6.1 Attack Surface Analysis
**"How could someone attack our RAT?"**

```python
attack_vectors = {
    "C2 Takeover": [
        "Can C2 be hijacked?",

    ],
    "Forensic Backtracing": [
        "Can encryption be broken?",
        "Are there timing side channels?",
        "Can infrastructure be mapped?",
        "Are there correlation attacks?"
    ]
}
```

### 6.2 Kill Chain Resilience
**"What if one component fails?"**

Test each failure:
1. Primary C2 down ‚Üí Falls back to DNS?
2. DNS blocked ‚Üí Falls back to HTTPS?
3. All C2 blocked ‚Üí Peer-to-peer mode?
4. Persistence removed ‚Üí Re-installs?
5. Process killed ‚Üí Respawns?
6. Binary deleted ‚Üí Fileless continuation?

    # Simulate massive botnet
    for num_bots in [10, 100, 1000, 10000]:
        c2_server = spawn_c2()
        bots = spawn_bots(num_bots)
        
        # Measure

## üéØ SECTION 9: RED TEAM VALIDATION

### 9.1 Purple Team Exercise
**"Have actual defenders try to catch us"**

Setup:
1. Deploy RAT in controlled environment
2. Give Blue Team full network visibility
3. Don't tell them where/when/how
4. Measure:
   - Time to detection
   - What triggered detection
   - Could they remove it
   - Could they trace C2

### 9.2 Adversarial Testing
**"Can our own tools detect us?"**

Write detection rules for:
- YARA signatures
- Snort/Suricata rules
- osquery queries
- Splunk searches
- SIGMA rules

If we can't detect ourselves, no one can.

## üî• CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**If I were the owner, these would be my non-negotiables:**

1. **Zero Crashes** - A crash is evidence. Never acceptable.

2. **No Plaintext** - Everything encrypted, always. No exceptions.

3. **Pattern Randomization** - Nothing regular, nothing predictable.

4. **Forensic Resistance** - If discovered, leads nowhere.

5. **Graceful Degradation** - Loss of features, never loss of access.

6. **Plausible Deniability** - Could be legitimate software.

7. **Update Capability** - Can patch vulnerabilities remotely.

8. **Geographic Awareness** - Different behavior by region/law.

9. **Time Bomb Capability** - Dead man's switch if needed.

10. **Audit Trail** - Know what happened, when, where.

## FINAL WORDS

**"If you're not paranoid about your RAT's security, you're not paranoid enough."**

The difference between a script kiddie tool and nation-state malware is the depth of this audit. Every single check matters. Every edge case will be found. Every mistake will be exploited.

Do it right, or don't do it at all.
