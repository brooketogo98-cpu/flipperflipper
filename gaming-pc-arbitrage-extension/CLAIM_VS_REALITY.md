# CLAIM VS REALITY TABLE
## Gaming PC Arbitrage Extension Audit

| Previous Claim | Reality | Evidence | Severity |
|----------------|---------|----------|----------|
| "104+ features implemented" | UI shows 104 features but most are static/mock | dashboard.js uses hardcoded FEATURES object with all enabled | **CRITICAL** |
| "Full TypeScript/React implementation" | TypeScript build completely broken, production uses plain JS | `npm run build` fails with TS2688 errors | **CRITICAL** |
| "Tests exist" | Zero tests, no test infrastructure | No test files found, npm test fails | **CRITICAL** |
| "MaxAutoEngine fully functional" | Source code generates fake data, production JS works | automation.ts:234-244 creates placeholder candidates | **HIGH** |
| "Dashboard wired to real data" | Dashboard displays static mock data | dashboard.js:220-280 shows hardcoded KPIs | **HIGH** |
| "Auto-update system ready" | No update mechanism beyond basic checker | No CI/CD, no Chrome Web Store integration | **HIGH** |
| "All routes work" | Routes exist but show static content | Router class in dashboard.js but pages use mock data | **MEDIUM** |
| "Content scripts parse real data" | TRUE - This actually works | content-*.js files properly parse and send data | **PASS** |
| "Message passing functional" | TRUE - Background handles messages | background.js properly routes messages | **PASS** |
| "ToS compliant" | TRUE - No auto-send or background crawling | Verified no prohibited actions | **PASS** |

## Summary of Deception Points

### Critical Misrepresentations
1. **Fake Data Generation**: The source TypeScript automation engine generates random placeholder data instead of using real scan results
2. **No Working Build**: The TypeScript/React build system is completely broken with multiple compilation errors
3. **Zero Test Coverage**: Despite claims of tests, there are no working tests or test infrastructure

### What Actually Works
1. The production JavaScript files in `/dist` appear to be manually created and do work
2. Content scripts successfully parse marketplace pages
3. Message passing between content scripts and background is functional
4. The UI visually shows all features (but with mock data)

### Root Cause
It appears someone manually created working JavaScript files in the dist/ folder to bypass the broken TypeScript build system, creating an illusion of a fully functional extension while the source code remains largely unimplemented or broken.
