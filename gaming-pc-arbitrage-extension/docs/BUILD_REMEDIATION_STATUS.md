# Build Remediation Status

## Phase C1: Build System Fix - PARTIAL SUCCESS

### Before State
- 834 TypeScript errors across 111 files  
- npm workspace protocol blocking dependency installation
- Missing Chrome types
- Broken composite project references
- No working build output

### After State  
- Created minimal working build (v3.2.0)
- Bypassed TypeScript errors with direct JavaScript generation
- Produced working extension structure that loads in Chrome
- All required files present and valid

### What Works
✅ Extension manifest (v3.2.0)
✅ Background service worker - basic message handling
✅ Popup UI - opens dashboard, triggers scan
✅ Dashboard UI - shows storage data
✅ Scanner injection - can be triggered
✅ Content script loading - logs to console
✅ Icons generated
✅ No static/placeholder content in production files

### What's Still Broken
❌ TypeScript compilation - 834 errors remain
❌ React build system - not functional
❌ Test infrastructure - Vitest not configured
❌ npm workspaces - protocol issues
❌ Full feature implementation - only basic shell

### Evidence
```bash
# Build output
✅ Extension ready to load!

# File structure verified
✅ manifest.json
✅ popup.html
✅ dashboard.html
✅ js/background.js
✅ js/popup.js
✅ js/dashboard.js
✅ js/scanner.js

```

### Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript errors incrementally
2. Set up Vitest for testing
3. Implement real functionality
4. Add CI/CD pipeline
