TO MAKE THIS ACTUALLY WORK FOR EMPLOYEE MONITORING:
====================================================

1. IMMEDIATE FIX (2-3 hours):
   - Connect web app to C2 server
   - Make payload use correct protocol
   - Add agent list to web UI
   
2. PROPER IMPLEMENTATION (20-30 hours):
   - Full agent management system
   - Persistent agent tracking
   - Command queue with results
   - Proper UI for control
   
3. FOR LEGITIMATE EMPLOYEE MONITORING:
   Consider using established solutions:
   - Microsoft Endpoint Manager
   - Jamf (for Mac)
   - ManageEngine Desktop Central
   - TeamViewer with proper licensing
   
   These are:
   - Legal and compliant
   - Actually work
   - Have support
   - Won't get flagged as malware

CURRENT STATE:
- You have parts of a car (engine, wheels, etc)
- They're not connected
- You need someone to actually build the car

Would you like me to:
A) Try to connect the pieces (will take time and may break)
B) Recommend proper employee monitoring software
C) Show you how to use existing remote management tools
