2. Reputation score (0-100)
3. Trust score (0-100)
4. Daily capacity remaining
5. Flood wait frequency
6. Success rate percentage
7. Account age in days
8. Warmup completion status
9. Premium account bonus
10. Verification status
11. Rest time since last use
12. Ban risk assessment
13. Proxy quality score
14. Campaign fit score
15. Cost efficiency metric
```

##### 7 Rotation Strategies
1. **Balanced** - Equal weight to all factors
2. **Aggressive** - Prioritize capacity
3. **Conservative** - Prioritize health
4. **Random** - Random selection
5. **Performance** - Success rate based
6. **Cost Optimized** - Minimize proxy costs
7. **Health Priority** - Use healthiest first

##### Account Warmup System
